## About / Growth Philosophy

I build growth engines that compound. Not through spray-and-pray tactics, but through systematic experimentation, deep distribution work, and a relentless focus on metrics that matter.

**What I believe:**
- Growth is a function of distribution + product-market fit + execution speed
- Communities are the best distribution channel in Web3 — but only if you treat them as partnerships, not channels
- On-chain metrics don't lie. Volume, retention, and network effects are the only signals that count
- Offline drives online. IRL activations create trust that online funnels convert
- Early incentives compound. The users you acquire in weeks 1-4 become your best advocates in months 3-6

I move fast, ship in public, and own outcomes end-to-end.

## Core Growth Case Studies

### TON House of Stars
**Co-Founder & Head of Growth** | [Project](https://x.com/tonhouseofstars)

Telegram Stars exchange on TON. Built to solve the friction problem: users earn Stars, but cashing out requires complex off-ramps. We built the first seamless Stars → TON exchange directly in Telegram.

**My role:**
- Co-founded the product and owned growth 0→1
- Built partnership strategy with top TON projects to drive supply & demand
- Designed early user incentive programs to bootstrap liquidity
- Executed community growth, BD, and product-led distribution

**Growth playbook:**
- **Partnership-driven distribution:** Locked strategic partnerships with leading TON projects to create bidirectional flow (their users cash out Stars → we provide liquidity → they get TON for operations)
- **Early user incentives:** Structured rewards for first 100 users to bootstrap network effects and create FOMO
- **Community-first:** Built in public, leveraged TON builder community, and positioned as infrastructure (not competition)

**Metrics:**
- ~$7,500 volume in < 2 months
- 145+ users
- 47% WoW user growth
- 60% WoW volume growth

**The story:** Zero infrastructure, zero distribution, zero brand recognition. In 8 weeks: live product, partnerships locked, users trading, volume compounding weekly.

### Nest Wallet
**Regional Growth Lead** | [Company](https://x.com/nestwalletxyz) | Reference: @bigzuko_ (X)

Multi-chain wallet building the UX layer for Web3. My remit: grow user base and on-chain activity in my region through offline activation + online conversion.

**My role:**
- Owned regional growth strategy and execution
- Hosted IRL educational events on university campuses
- Served as regional ambassador at major Web3 events
- Collaborated with global growth team on product positioning and funnel optimization

**Growth playbook:**
- **IRL → Online funnel:** Educational campus events to build trust, then convert sign-ups with product demos and incentives
- **Ambassador presence:** Showed up at every major regional event to build brand, collect leads, and create local network effects
- **Data-driven iteration:** Tracked on-chain activity post-signup to optimize event messaging and follow-up sequences

**Results:**
- ~$500k average daily volume (mid-December 2024)
- Multiple IRL campus events executed
- Increased regional sign-ups and on-chain activity
- Established Nest as a regional brand through consistent offline presence

**The story:** Web3 wallets are a commodity. Growth comes from trust and ease of use. We built that trust offline, converted it online, and the metrics followed.
